## Background on the project
This project is an assignment as a part of a course called Advanced Programming 1 in our Computer Seince degree of second year in Bar Ilan University.

## Part #1
In this first milestone of the project, we'll make a code parser that will remote control on a FlightGear simulator.

### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### How does it work


### Possible changes / improvments

* Implementing Singleton DP on The SymbolTable and the InterpreterTool members of the Parser,
  as well the Parser itself.
* Improve the FuncCommand and DefineFuncCommand to support multiple parameters of a function.
